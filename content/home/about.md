# Biography

I am a NERC-funded PhD student at the University of Oxford's Department of Zoology. My research interests are broadly centred around understanding how organisms adapt to environmental change, with a particular interest in the genomic-level changes that take place following the establishment of new populations. I am particularly interested in the effects of population founding. Other interests include: landscape genetics, conservation genetics, and bioinformatics.
